# Motion Design Principles

## Core Philosophy

> "The best animation is that which goes unnoticed"

Motion should support comprehension, feedback, and polish. It should not become a performance burden or decorative noise.

The starter defaults to **restraint + speed + purposeful motion**.

## 12 Principles -> UI application

### 1. Squash & Stretch

- Good for small press feedback, such as button active states.
- Keep it subtle. Avoid cartoon-like stretching in professional pages.

### 2. Anticipation

- Use hover, focus, or pressed states to preview interaction.
- Do not add delays that make the UI feel slow.

### 3. Staging

- Direct attention to one thing at a time.
- Use modal backdrops, focused cards, or step-by-step reveal only when it clarifies hierarchy.

### 4. Straight Ahead vs Pose to Pose

- Web UI should normally use pose-to-pose: define start and end states and let the browser interpolate.
- Skip animation when the static state is already clear.

### 5. Follow Through & Overlapping Action

- Stagger can help section or list reveals.
- Keep total stagger short; long delays make pages feel sluggish.
- Spring or overshoot should be exceptional, not the default language.

### 6. Slow In & Slow Out

- Entrance: `ease-out`
- Exit: `ease-in`
- On-screen movement: `ease-in-out`
- Avoid `linear` except for continuous loaders or progress motion.

### 7. Arcs

- Curved motion can feel more natural in special moments.
- Most website UI should use simple, direct movement.

### 8. Secondary Action

- Use small secondary effects to reinforce success, validation, or selection.
- Secondary motion must not distract from the primary action.

### 9. Timing

| Scene | Duration | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Tooltip / hover feedback | 100-150ms | Immediate |
| Button state change | 150-200ms | Fast |
| Panel / card expand | 200-300ms | Smooth but not slow |
| Page-level transition | 300-500ms | Needs a reason |
| Drawer / modal | ~500ms | Only when the component needs weight |

Rule: common UI interaction motion should usually stay under 300ms.

### 10. Exaggeration

- Use sparingly for error feedback or onboarding.
- Avoid exaggerated movement in trust-building pages.

### 11. Solid Drawing

- Keep perspective, scale, and transform direction consistent.
- Avoid awkward flips or 3D effects that weaken readability.

### 12. Appeal

- Good motion makes the interface feel cared for.
- If users notice the animation more than the content, reduce it.

## Starter motion strategy

Use motion for:

- button and link feedback;
- form validation and success states;
- dialog, sheet, dropdown, accordion states;
- lightweight section reveal when it improves scanning;
- component state changes in Storybook.

Avoid motion for:

- pure spectacle;
- hiding weak content;
- heavy scroll effects on normal pages;
- repeated animation that competes with reading.

## Technical constraints

- Prefer `transform` and `opacity`.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Keep timings and easing consistent through tokens or shared classes.
- Do not introduce heavy animation runtime unless a real project needs it.

## Tooling reference

| Layer | Tool / doc | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decision | this document | Decide whether motion is useful |
| Design context | `DESIGN.md` / `docs/design-truth.md` | Confirm tone and boundaries |
| Component review | Storybook | Preview states and transitions |
| Implementation | CSS / Tailwind / `tailwindcss-animate` | Default implementation layer |
