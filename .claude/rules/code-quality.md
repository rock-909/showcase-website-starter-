# Code Quality Rules

Use this file for source shape, complexity, imports, constants, and lint
exception policy.

## Complexity thresholds

These are review thresholds, not mechanical rewrite targets.

| File type | max lines | max lines per function | complexity | max depth | max params |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Production | 500 | 120 | 15 | 3 | 3 |
| Config | 800 | 250 | 18 | - | - |
| Test | 800 | 700 | 20 | - | 8 |

If code crosses a threshold, first identify the real boundary:

- route orchestration
- data/model preparation
- presenter/formatting logic
- platform adapter
- security/input boundary
- reusable UI component

Do not split code only to satisfy a number. Prefer a clear exception over
helper piles, object-parameter bags, or generic constants.

## ESLint disables

Use the smallest possible scope and name the exact rule:

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion -- validated by Zod above
const email = parsed.data.email!;
```

No broad file-level disables without a current, specific reason.

## Magic numbers

Named constants are for values with domain meaning:

- HTTP status codes
- timeouts and retry delays
- cache TTLs
- rate limits
- byte sizes
- token lengths
- business limits

Direct literals are fine for language and UI idioms such as array index `0`,
`slice(..., -1)`, `strokeWidth={2}`, opacity defaults, or small layout counts.

Do not introduce `ZERO`, `ONE`, or similar aliases unless the name carries real
domain meaning.

## Hard gates

- TypeScript: zero errors
- ESLint: zero warnings
- Build: no errors

Production code must not import `src/test/**`, `src/testing/**`, or
`src/constants/test-*`.

## Upgrade drift

- Do not copy old framework examples without checking the installed docs.
- When a package upgrade changes the public API shape, update the rule or proof
  doc that controls future use of that API in the same branch.
- Prefer deleting stale compatibility comments over adding new wrappers around
  obsolete behavior.
- If a warning is intentionally accepted, record the owner and proof boundary;
  do not let it become anonymous build noise.
